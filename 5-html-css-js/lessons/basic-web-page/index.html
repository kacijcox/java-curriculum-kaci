        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat">
            The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat, <span style="color:red"> is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. </span> It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship
